# mpower

mpower is a small HTML email generation framework. Inspired by command-line utilities such as [compass](http://compass-style.org) and [nanoc](http://nanoc.stoneship.org/), has a simple aim. To make the laborious task of creating and styling HTML emails, a little bit less of a complete pain in the backside.

mpower currently boasts the following features:

* A structured framework so that your campaign project is neatly organised.
* Several different ways of using *partials* and *layouts* so you can build complex campaigns with a lot less markup.
* Use CSS to your heart's content and allow mpower to automatically move all the styles to inline attributes.
* mpower automatically tidies and corrects all your HTML markup.

## Project status

mpower is current at version 0 and is in development. Most of the features list above do work, but there is plenty still to do in terms of testing, documenting, capturing errors, and generally making everything a bit more polished.

If you're feeling brave, feel free to download this repo and start playing, but please bare in mind this is a very early work in progress.

## Contributing to mpower
 
* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet
* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it
* Fork the project
* Start a feature/bugfix branch
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
